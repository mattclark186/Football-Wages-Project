**Goal:** To investigate whether the best football (soccer) players get paid the highest wages. 

**Description:** The dataset was scraped from a website using Python. It contained information about different football teams from different European countries over the previous 10 seasons - specifically how much they paid their players and how well the teams performed. The data was then cleaned in MySQL and manipulated into useful tables. The tables were imported into Tableau to be visualised. 

**Conclusion:** Often the team paying the highest wages finsihes 1st in the league but not always. It's clear that paying players higher wages generally results in a better performance overall. In most leagues it's common for the highest paying team to finsih 1st. However, there are a significant number of instances where this is not the case, with more in some leagues than others but at least 1 in each league over the previous 10 seasons.
